⚠️ Since the release [v0.29.0](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/releases/tag/v0.29.0) of Lucide, the icon font is now available. Therefore, I no longer see any reason to care about this repository.

# Lucide Icon Font

This icon font version uses the icons from [Lucide](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/) ([v0.17.15](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide/releases/tag/v0.17.15)).

The SVG files has to be converted from strokes to fills with the help of the Iconly tool [Convert SVG Strokes to Fills](https://iconly.io/tools/svg-convert-stroke-to-fill), they can be found in the folder called `svgs-converted`, then the icon font was generated with [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/).
